Overview:
This is the first html/css/javascript project I created mostly while on the waitlist to join the Get Coding program and continue to work on as I formally begin the program. The purpose of this project is to select a restaurant in the St. John's metro region based on selections for cuisine type, neighbourhood and price point.

Outline:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create three pages:

1. The Home page contains a form with dropdowns the user can use to make selections for cuisine type, neighbourhood and price point that will be used to select a suitable restaurant in the St. John's Metro area.

2. The Buy Gift Cards page contains links to the restaurant's webpages for each restaurant featured in this project.
3. The Menus page contains links to the menus of each restaurant featured in this project.

How it Works:

1. The user will select a cuisine type (Pizza, Mexican, or Sushi), neighbourhood (Downtown, East End, or West End), and price point ($, $$, or $$$) then clicks the "Submit" button.
2. JavaScript is used to loop through 15 different restaurant variables that have their name, cuisine type, neighbourhood, and price point listed in arrays then record the restaurants which meet all the users criteria.
3. A pop-up window will then be displayed to indicate the restaurant(s) that meet the users selected criteria. If no restaurants meet the user's selected criteria, a pop-up window will be displayed to indicate that no restaurants meet their chosen criteria.
