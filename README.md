Overview:
This is the first html/css/javascript project I created in the Get Coding program. The purpose of this project is to select a restaurant in the St. John's metro region based on selections for neighbourhood and price point.

I created this project because I love going out to eat in St. John's but can never remember the different restaurants I want to try when it comes time to pick one. I like using this application to remind myself of the restaurant options available in each region of the city when choosing which one to eat at.

How it Works:

1. The user will select a neighbourhood (Downtown, City Centre, East End, West End, North End, Mount Pearl, Paradise or CBS), and price point ($, $$, or $$$) then clicks the "Submit" button.
2. The Google Maps API makes a call using the Places Library to return restaurants in the users selected area and price point.
3. Markers are generated to mark restaurants on the map and results are listed in the 'Results' section of the page.
