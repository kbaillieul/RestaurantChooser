Overview:
This is the first html/css/javascript project I created in the Get Coding program. The purpose of this project is to select a restaurant in the St. John's metro region based on selections for neighbourhood and price point.

How it Works:

1. The user will select a neighbourhood (Downtown, City Centre, East End, West End, North End, Mount Pearl, Paradise or CBS), and price point ($, $$, or $$$) then clicks the "Submit" button.
2. The Google Maps API makes a call using the Places Library to return restaurants in the users selected area and price point.
3. Markers are generated to mark restaurants on the map and results are listed in the 'Results' section of the page.
