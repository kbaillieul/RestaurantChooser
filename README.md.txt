Overview
This is the first html/css/javascript project I created while on the waitlist to join the Get Coding program. The purpose of this project is to select a restaurant in the St. John's metro region based on selections for cuisine type, neighbourhood and price point. 

Outline 
HTML and CSS were used to create the page layout which has three main sections:
1. The first section at the top is a box containing the project title ("St. John's Metro Region Restaurant Chooser").
2. The second section is a box which contains user instuctions on how to use the application.
3. Finally the third section is a box which is split in two. The left side contains a Google Map with markers for each restaurant included in my project using the Google Maps API. The right side contains a form which allows the user to select from a drop-down menu for cuisine type, neighbourhood, and price point.
